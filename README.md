#### A Product Management Professional from India. 

##### 👒 Some Hats I Wear: Python + JAMstack + [FARM](https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/FARM-Stack-FastAPI-React-MongoDB) Stack Developer, Designer, Marketeer, S.E.O Consultant And Automation Junkie.

I’m a passionate entrepreneur with over 5 years of experience in building & scaling initiatives. I aim to combine my insights to join and help teams collaboratively identify pain points, automate/optimize workflows and reach goals. 

I'm passionate about working with initiatives and teams that promote mental health, animal care, create impact or make life easier.

#### What Would You Find On My GitHub? 
- Projects and working concepts that have helped automate/optimize mundane tasks, or test out new concepts.
- Projects that support my work as the Co-Founder and Product Lead at [TheMindClan](https://themindclan.com), a platform that's making mental health accessible (and a personal journey) to Indians.

#### What Do I Code In? 💻
I try learn any language that can help the teams of various projects I'm part of. My first preference would be Python (FastAPI/Flask/Django)  & Hugo with whichever front-end framework that works for the project. I've got a soft corner for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [bootstrap](https://getBootstrap.com/) (*SUPER* pumped for version 5 btw). 

#### Some Projects I've Worked On: 
- [Hugon](https://github.com/hithismani/hugon): Python script that simplifies working with archetypes in Hugo. Enables bulk markdown file creation/editing via a single .csv! 
- [SwitchCase.xyz](https://github.com/hithismani/switchcase): Text/sentence conversion into random, sentence, capital, upper, lower, slug case including illegal case removal! Privacy friendly, quick, free and open source!
- [SyncWP](https://github.com/hithismani/syncwp): CLI script to migrate a PHP/Wordpress site from your local non/docker machine to a WPCLI + SSH enabled server. Seeks commands via a .YAML config file. Of course, this was before I moved almost all projects to JAMstack on [Netlify.](https://netlify.com)
- [File2Drive](https://github.com/hithismani/file2drive):  Experimental script to transfer all files straight into another folder (eg: OneDrive, DropBox, System) using Python. Useful for automating font backups.
- [PicToSquare](https://github.com/hithismani/pictosquare): Experimental script that uses Python to enter a directory and make pictures “Instagram Ready” by framing them up into a no-crop square. 
- [PowFile](https://github.com/hithismani/powfile):  Quick script to help switch up Windows Powershell profile files or reset them back to normal. Useful for live demos & shell recording sessions.

#### What Can I Help You With? 🆘
- I can be your resident entrepreneur, working with you to solve any challenge you're experiencing. 
- I can help you find out ways to automate the tasks you didn't know needed automation.
- I can help you adopt the best ~~agile strategies for your product~~ cat/dog for your mental health. _(Just kidding, I can help you with both)_
- Opening your perspective on how having womxn (and intersectional representation) in tech/positions of power can actually help you and the overall ecosystem.

#### Open Source Projects That Have Caught My Eye: 👀
- [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/): Doing to task automation, what [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) has done to email marketing.
