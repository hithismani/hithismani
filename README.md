#### A Product Management Professional From India. 

##### 👒 I Wear The Hats Of A Python + JAMstack Developer, Designer, Marketer, S.E.O Consultant and Automation Junkie

I’m a passionate entrepreneur with over 5 years of experience in building & scaling initiatives. I aim to combine my insights to join and help teams collaboratively identify pain points, automate/optimize workflows and reach goals. 

I'm passionate about working with initiatives and teams that promote mental health, animal care, create impact or make life easier.

#### What would you find on my GitHub? 
- Projects and working concepts that have helped automate/optimize mundane tasks for my life as a developer.
- Projects that support my work as the Co-Founder and Product Lead at [TheMindClan](https://themindclan.com), a platform that's making mental health accessible (and a personal journey) to Indians.

#### What Do I Code In? 💻
Any language that I can pick up, to help the teams of various projects I'm part of. My first preference would be Python (FastAPI/Flask/Django)  & Hugo with whichever front-end framework that works for the project. I've got a soft corner for [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). 

#### Some Projects I've Worked On: 
- [Hugon](https://github.com/hithismani/hugon): Python script that simplifies working with archetypes in Hugo. Enables bulk markdown file creation/editing via a single .csv!

- [SyncWP](https://github.com/hithismani/syncwp): CLI script to migrate a PHP/Wordpress site from your local non/docker machine to a WPCLI + SSH enabled server. Seeks commands via a .YAML config file.
- [File2Drive](https://github.com/hithismani/file2drive):  Experimental script to transfer all files straight into another folder (eg: OneDrive, DropBox, System) using Python. Useful for automating font backups.
- [PicToSquare](https://github.com/hithismani/pictosquare): Experimental script that uses Python to enter a directory and make pictures “Instagram Ready” by framing them up into a no-crop square. 
- [PowFile](https://github.com/hithismani/powfile):  Quick script to help switch up Windows Powershell profile files or reset them back to normal. Useful for live demos & shell recording sessions.
